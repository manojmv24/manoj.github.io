## Abstract

Graphical-design-based symptomatic techniques in pandemics perform a quintessential purpose in screening hit causes that comparatively render better outcomes amongst the principal radioscopy mechanisms in recognizing and diagnosing COVID-19 cases. The deep learning paradigm has been applied vastly to investigate radiographic images such as Chest X-Rays (CXR) and Computer Tomography (CT) scan images. These radiographic images are rich in information such as patterns and clusters like structures, which are evident in conformance and detection of COVID-19 like pandemics. 

This paper aims to comprehensively study and analyze detection methodology based on Deep learning techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep learning technology is a good, practical, and affordable modality that can be deemed a reliable technique for adequately diagnosing the COVID-19 virus. Furthermore, the research determines the potential to enhance image character through artificial intelligence and distinguishes the most inexpensive and most trustworthy imaging method to anticipate dreadful viruses.

This paper further discusses the cost-effectiveness of the surveyed methods for detecting COVID 19, in contrast with the other methods. Several finance-related aspects of COVID 19 detection effectiveness of different methods used for COVID 19 detection have been discussed. Overall, this study presents an overview of COVID 19 detection using deep learning methods and their cost-effectiveness and financial implications from the perspective of insurance claim settlement.
